# General Overview
This section talks about the general overview of the project methodology used, the problems and difficulties we faced during the project, things we could have done better, lessons we learnt and what we could have done differently.
## Organisation and Methodology
We followed SCRUM methodology for this project. Although, the working on this project significantly stalled due to various reasons, we were still fairly methodical in following the SCRUM methodology. In this project, we had three sprints over a short during of time. We discussed our backlogs and proceeded with each sprints at a time. For this project, Aditya Das acted as the SCRUM Master.
## Difficulties we faced
1. There was initially a lack of cohesion and understanding within the group members.<br><br>
2. Two out of the three group members suffered from significant personal tragedies during the course of this project, which greatly hampered its progress.<br><br>
3. Due to the late starting of the work as a group, the bulk of the work was done during Sprint 3, which created a lot of pressure on individual group members.<br><br>
4. We faced certain technical difficulties with regards to the synchronisation of the different parts of the project.

## Lessons we have learnt
During a group project, collective cooperation and harmony is extremely essential when we talk about reaching the goal on time.
## Things to do differently
1. We would start the project at an early onset.<br><br>
2. Have greater amount of communication and understanding between the group members.
